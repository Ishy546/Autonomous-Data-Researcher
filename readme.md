**AI Research Agent API**

A lightweight AI-powered research API built with TypeScript, Express, and OpenAI tool calls.
This project implements an autonomous research agent that plans, searches, ranks, and synthesizes information into a structured response.

**🚀 Features**

Planner – Uses LangChain + OpenAI to break down a user query into 3 focused sub-questions.
Search – Integrates the Tavily API to perform single or batch web searches with result formatting.
Ranker – Uses the OpenAI API to evaluate and rank search results for relevance and reliability.
Writer – Generates polished, natural-language answers using OpenAI completions.
Agent Loop – Iteratively reasons and decides which tools to call until a final answer is ready.
Express API – Exposes a /research endpoint that accepts a query and returns a structured answer.


**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
AI: OpenAI API (Chat Completions, Tool Calls), LangChain
Search: Tavily API
Other: Modular tool design for planner, search, ranker, and writer function
